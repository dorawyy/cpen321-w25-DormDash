# Requirements and Design

## 1. Change History

| **Change Date** | **Modified Sections** | **Rationale**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------| --------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2025-10-21     | Requirements Specification: Functional Requirements: Features | We changed our feature names to match their use cases, and created new use cases. Why: To have a more logically organized formal specification of our features.                                                                                                         |
| 2025-10-21     | Requirements Specification: Functional Requirements: Use Cases | We changed the names, descriptions, and success scenarios of our use cases and the actors involved. Why: To match the reality of our actual implementation of the features.                                                                                             | 
| 2025-10-21     | Requirements Specification: Use Case Diagram | Changed our use case diagram to match the new use cases. Why: To ensure consistency throughout our requirements specification.                                                                                                                                          |
| 2025-10-22     | Requirements Specification: Formal Use Case Specification | Updated the formal use case specifications according to the new feature/use case descriptions. Why: To reflect our changes and keep consistent definitions for our use cases.                                                                                           |
| 2025-10-22     | Requirements Specification: Actor Descriptions | Changed external service names. Why: To keep the naming consistent.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2025-10-22     | Requirements Specification: Non-Functional Requirements | Changed our second non-functional requirement to a UI response requirement. Why: This is a more specific constraint and better reflects our implementation choices.                                                                                                     |
| 2025-10-22     | Design | Added Jobs component and RoutePlanner component to the design description and diagram. Why: Jobs were added because orders are a two-phase service (storage and return); RoutePlanner was separated out to follow separation of concerns and encapsulate routing logic. |
| 2025-11-12 | Requirement | We changed the requirements to not mention user can change profile picture. Why: we are no longer having profile picture in our app and need to ensure our documentation matches the functionality |
| 2025-11-12 | Use Case Specification | We changed the 'View Recommended Route' use case to use a slider, instead of a multiple choice list. For selecting the duration of the route. |
| 2025-11-12 | Requirements: Non-Functional Requirement | Changed our first non-functional requirement to 200 concurrent requests, of which 70% are to create orders and 30% are to get jobs. Why: We are restricted by our free-tier service, 400 was not feasible.               
| 2025-11-12 | Requirements: Non-Functional Requirement | Changed our second non-functional requirement to a response to core functionalites independent of a backend response. Why: Between network failures, and the limitation of our backend tier, 0.1s for a response to arrive and be reflected was not reasible. Additionally, the applicated is not always open. So student and movers not seeing changes (job creation, order and job status updates) reflected from the backend within 0.1s, does not reduce the app's appeal.

## 2. Project Description

Students living in dorms often struggle with limited space and the hassle of moving or storing personal belongings. Seasonal room changes, summer breaks, or even short-term needs like storing sports gear or bulky items create recurring challenges. Right now, students usually have to arrange storage themselves, which means finding a place that balances price and convenience, coordinating transportation, and dealing with storage durations that rarely match their needs. This process is time-consuming, stressful, and often more expensive than necessary.

DormDash provides a complete, stress-free solution. Through an Uber-like app, students can request “movers” who will pick up, transport, and securely store their belongings in company-managed storage facilities—so students never have to worry about finding or arranging a storage location themselves. Items can be stored for exactly the amount of time needed, tracked through the app, and scheduled for return on a chosen date, when movers will deliver them directly to the specified location. With two modes—one for students using the service and one for movers—DormDash makes the entire moving and storage experience seamless, reliable, and tailored to student life.

## 3.1 List of Project Features

1. **Authenticate**  
   Users (students and movers) can sign up, sign in, and sign out using Google OAuth. 

2. **Manage Profile**  
   Users can view and edit their profile details (name, and bio). 

3. **Manage Orders**  
   Students can use the storage service by creating an order: in which they specify a pickup and expected return date, receive a price quote, make a payment, and track the status of their order if it's been placed successfully,or if it's still pending or if a mover has accepted the order. Once the mover picks up their items, the student is prompted to confirm that their order has been picked up. If the order status is currently in storage, students can confirm the return job, if they have passed the expected return date they will pay the extra difference. If they are requesting a return before the expected return date, they are given a partial refund. Students can track the status of their stored items in real time and cancel their current active order request before a mover accepts it, with refunds issued automatically. They can also view past order history.

4. **Find Jobs**  
   Movers can view available jobs, filter based on time, and have the option to accept jobs. Movers can also view a recommended route suggestion, which is an optimized chain of orders. Movers can accept some, or all of the orders in the suggestion. 

5. **Manage Accepted Jobs and Earnings**  
   Movers can view details of jobs they have accepted including active and completed jobs. Movers can update the status of an active job based on their progress (when they have arrived at the student’s pickup location or at the storage warehouse, etc.). This will result in a live update for the student whose order is associated with the job. After completing an active job, movers receive credit for completing the order. Movers can view details of all completed jobs, and mock transferring their earnings to their personal account.

6. **Add to Calendar**  
   Movers can add accepted jobs (storage or return phase) timings to their calendar. Students can add accepted orders’ ( in their storage or return phase ) timings to their calendar.

### **3.2. Use Case Diagram**
![Use Case Diagram](./images/Use_Case_diagram.jpg)


### **3.3. Actors Description**
1. **Student**: Creates storage order (pickup or return), pays, views order status, confirms when mover has arrived to pickup/deliver their items.
2. **Mover**: Browses/accepts jobs, completes pickup/return jobs, can cash out earnings.
3. **User**: Embodies an entity whose actions are shared by both student and mover. This includes authentication use cases, managing profile and adding 
4. **Mock Stripe**: Manages student payment and routes refunds back to their card. 
5. **Google Maps**: Used for address geocoding to get a price quote and to validate addresses are within serviced area (Greater Vancouver).
6. **Firebase Cloud Messaging Service**: Used to send notifications to students when the status of their order changes and when the mover has arrived to pickup or return their items.
7. **Google OAuth**: Used to create authentication tokens for users and verify existing ones.


### **3.4. Use Case Description**

- **Use cases for feature 1: Authenticate**  
  1. **Sign up**: User can register an account with a role (student or mover).  
  2. **Sign in**: User can initiate an active session and access their account.  
  3. **Sign out**: User can terminate an active session.  
  4. **Delete Account**: User can delete their account in DormDash.

- **Use cases for feature 2: Manage Profile**  
  1. **Edit Profile**: Users can view the name, and bio associated with their account  
  2. **View Profile**:  Users can edit the name, and bio associated with their account 

- **Use cases for feature 3: Manage Orders**  
  1. **Create order**: The student enters addresses, pickup & expected return times, and volume of their items. The system validates the address is within the Greater Vancouver area, and returns a price quote with a breakdown. The student can pay and submit their order.  
  2. **Pay**: The student can pay for the quote they received which is the last step to create a successful order. A storage job is created (return job is created in the Confirm Return use case), and published to the job pool for the mover to view.  
  3. **Confirm Return**: If the current active order’s status is in-storage, students can schedule a return job, if they have passed the expected return date they will pay the extra difference. If they are requesting a return before the expected return date, they are given a partial refund.  
  4. **Confirm Mover Arrival**: When the mover picks up the student’s items from the pickup address or drops it off to their drop-off address, the student is prompted to confirm that their order has been picked up or dropped off, before the mover can update the order status any further (acts as a 2 way handshake between student and mover).  
  5. **View order history**: Students can view details of their past orders or their current active order. Details they can view include pickup/dropoff dates, address and volume of items, and the status of the order.  
  6. **Cancel pending order**: Students can cancel an order which is pending and receive a refund subject to refund policy. 

- **Use cases for feature 4: Find jobs**  
  1. **Set Availability**: The mover defines daily time periods for each day of the week where they are available to complete pick up orders. The system uses these slots to determine which jobs are eligible to be shown to mover if they choose to only view jobs within their availability.  
  2. **Browse and filter jobs**: The mover views jobs that are unassigned and they can filter based on their availability if they want to only see jobs within the availability they specified.  
  3. **Accept Job**: The mover accepts an unassigned job, then the system atomically assigns it and displays it in the “Current Jobs” page. The student is notified that their order has been accepted and a real time update is triggered for the student showing the new status of their order as Accepted.  
  4. **View recommended route**: The mover can view an recommended optimal route within the duration of time they are available for and depending on their current location. A list of jobs is suggested which maximizes their possible earnings which are on the way to each other. Movers can accept some or all of the jobs.

- **Use cases for feature 5: Manage Accepted Jobs and Earnings**  
  1. **View Job Details**: The mover views details of an active job they’ve accepted (pickup address, return address, status, volume, and scheduled time).  
  2. **View Job History**:  
     The mover views a record of all previously completed jobs, including date, location, volume, and earnings. This gives movers visibility into their performance and history.  
  3. **Update Accepted Job Status**:  
     The mover updates the status of a job. The system validates transitions and updates the student’s view in real-time. Mover receives credits upon job completion.  
  4. **Cash Out**:  
     The mover requests to withdraw accumulated earnings. The system mocks initiating a transfer to the mover’s connected account. [Note: mock since we do not actually want to store any bank information on our app for this course].

- **Use cases for feature 6: Add to Calendar**  
  1. **Add to Calendar**: The student can add accepted pickup or return dates of their order to their calendar once a mover accepts it. The mover can add schedules date/time of any of their accepted jobs to their calendar.

	- 6a1. Mover is notified that no jobs fit with a suggestion to change their availability and/or their duration windows.

### **3.6. Non Functional Requirements:**

1. **Scalability**  
   - **Description**: Handle short, predictable bursts around move-in/move-out while remaining simple enough for a student-built deployment.  
   - **Parameters**: Support a load of ~200 concurrent requests.  
   - **Justification**: UBC Vancouver alone has ~60k students, so even low adoption during peak periods can create bursts. In late April’s “Great Shuffle,” UBC reports ~7,000 residence moves in Vancouver (~9,100 system-wide including UBCO) within a single week. Designing for ~200 concurrent requests offers conservative headroom without requiring complex infrastructure.  

2. **UI Response Time**  
   - **Description**: Ensure responsiveness and reliability of UI interactions.  
   - **Parameters**: We want UI actions to reflect within 0.1s of change. For core functionalities, that do not depend on the backends response.
   - **Justification**: Research on usability response times shows that sub-0.1s feedback feels instantaneous to users, improving trust and engagement ([Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/)).

            - **Purpose**: Retrieves detailed information for a specific job including addresses, scheduled time, and current status.
        5. `Job updateJobStatus(String jobId, JobStatus status, String moverId)`
            - **Purpose**: Updates job status after validating the mover's authorization and that the requested state transition is allowed, with atomic acceptance to prevent race conditions; triggers order status updates for student and sends notifications to students.
        6. `Job requestPickupConfirmation(String jobId, String moverId)`
            - **Purpose**: Mover indicates arrival at student's pickup location for storage jobs; changes job status to 'awaiting student confirmation' and notifies student that the mover has arrived and prompts them to confirm pickup of items.
        7. `Job confirmPickup(String jobId, String studentId)`
            - **Purpose**: Student is verified to be tied to this job and confirms mover has picked up items for storage job; job and order statuses are changed to 'picked up'.
        8. `Job requestDeliveryConfirmation(String jobId, String moverId)`
            - **Purpose**: Mover indicates items have been delivered for return jobs; changes job status to awaiting student confirmation' and notifies student that the mover has arrived and prompts them to confirm delivery of items.
        9. `Job confirmDelivery(String jobId, String studentId)`
            - **Purpose**: Student confirms items were delivered for return job; marks job as COMPLETED, credits mover, and updates order status to COMPLETED.
        10. `Job createJob(String orderId, String studentId, JobType jobType, Double volume, Double price, Address pickupAddress, Address dropoffAddress, DateTime scheduledTime)`
            - **Purpose**: Creates a new job (storage or return) linked to the given order and student; sets initial status to AVAILABLE and emits real-time event to display job to movers.
        11. `void cancelJobsForOrder(String orderId, String actorId)`
            - **Purpose**: Cancels all uncompleted jobs for an order when order is cancelled; updates status to CANCELLED and emits events to update movers' "Find Jobs" or "Current Jobs" pages. 


5.**RoutePlanner**

   - **Interfaces**:
        1.` SuggestedRoute calculateSmartRoute(String moverId, LatLng currentLocation, Int maxDuration) `
            - **Purpose**: Calculates optimal route for mover based on current location and time constraints. Returns route with jobs ordered by composite score balancing earnings and proximity.
        2.` Job[] filterJobsByAvailability(Job[] jobs, DayAvailability availability)`
            - **Purpose**: Filters available jobs to only include those that fall within mover's availability time windows. Checks if job start and end times fit within any availability slot for the scheduled day.
        3.` JobWithValue[] calculateJobValues(Job[] jobs)`
            - **Purpose**: Calculates value score (earnings per minute) for each job. Returns jobs with valueScore.
        4. `Int estimateJobDuration(double volume) `
            - **Purpose**: Estimates job duration based on item volume using formula. Returns duration in minutes.
        5. `JobInRoute[] buildOptimalRoute(JobWithValue[] jobs, Location startLocation, DayAvailability availability, Integer maxDuration)`
            - **Purpose**: Greedy algorithm that iteratively selects the best job to add to the route based on value and distance. Stops when maxDuration is reached or no more jobs fit within the availability. Returns ordered list of jobs with travel 				details.
        6. `AssignmentResult acceptSuggestedRoute(String moverId, String suggestedRouteId, String[] acceptedJobIds)`
            - **Purpose**: Assigns selected jobs from suggested route to mover; atomically accepts jobs and returns AssignmentResult which includes successfully accepted jobs and any that were already taken by other movers.

### **4.7. Design and Ways to Test Non-Functional Requirements**
1. [**[Scalability]**](#nfr1)
    - **Validation**: The backend is containerized (see dockerfile and docker-compose.yml) and uses a horizontally-scalable Node + MongoDB stack with a pooled Mongoose connection (see mongoose.util.ts), plus real-time sockets (socket.ts) and an internal event-based worker path (eventEmitter.util.ts) so bursty work (notifications, cleanup, billing) can be handled asynchronously and scaled out with more containers or an external worker queue when needed
2. [**[UI Response Time]**](#nfr2)

    - **Validation**: The Android frontend uses Jetpack Compose with local, immediate UI state updates so interactions that don’t require a backend round-trip (box counters, date/time pickers, form input) update instantly on-device while network calls are performed asynchronously via the app’s repository/services layer, keeping core UI feedback below the 0.1s perceptual target
