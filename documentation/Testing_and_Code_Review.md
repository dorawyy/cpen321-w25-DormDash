## 3. Back-end Test Specification: Tests of Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Test Locations in Git

| **Non-Functional Requirement**  | **Location in Git**                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Performance (Response Time)** | [`tests/nonfunctional/response_time.test.js`](#) |
| **UI Responsivness**     | [`frontend/app/src/androidTest/java/com/cpen321/usermanagement/performance/UIResponsivness/MoverUIResponseTimeTest.kt`](#) [`frontend/app/src/androidTest/java/com/cpen321/usermanagement/performance/UIResponsivness/StudentUIResponseTimeTest.kt`](#) |

### 3.2. Test Verification and Logs

- **Performance (Response Time)**

    - **Verification:** This test suite simulates multiple concurrent API calls using Jest along with a load-testing utility to mimic real-world user behavior. The focus is on key endpoints such as user login and study group search to ensure that each call completes within the target response time of 2 seconds under normal load. The test logs capture metrics such as average response time, maximum response time, and error rates. These logs are then analyzed to identify any performance bottlenecks, ensuring the system can handle expected traffic without degradation in user experience.
    - **Log Output**
      ```
      [Placeholder for response time test logs]
      ```

- **UI Responsivness**
    - **Verification:** This test suite evaluates the responsiveness of core UI components that operate independently of API calls, focusing purely on client-side interactions. The goal is to ensure that user actions trigger visible state changes within 0.1 seconds, maintaining a seamless experience. For the Mover interface, tests cover interactions such as navigating to the Find Jobs screen, updating Availability, and clicking the Get Optimal Route button. For the Student interface, tests include actions like clicking Create New Order or editing the profile, verifying that UI feedback occurs within the defined responsiveness threshold.

   - **Running the Tests:**
  1. Create a **Mover** or **Student** account.  
  2. When prompted, enter text for the **bio** field and click **Save**.  
  3. Verify that only **one account** appears when clicking **Sign In**.  
  4. Before switching between **Mover** and **Student** tests, **delete the existing account** and create a new one by repeating the steps above.  
     - Avoid keeping both Mover and Student accounts saved simultaneously, as this may cause the test to sign in with the wrong account type (e.g., selecting a Mover account during a Student test), leading to test failures.
    
    *Note: Due to occasional UI flakiness, the test may need to be run up to three times before passing.*

    
    - **Log Output**

## 4. Front-end Test Specification
**Instructions to run the tests**:
- Create a test.properties file under DormDash/frontend/app/src/androidTest/resources
- Add the following to the file, and fill in 2 test accounts (1 for student and 1 for mover):
  STUDENT_EMAIL=<the email for the student account>
  STUDENT_PASSWORD=<the password for the student account>
  MOVER_EMAIL=<the email for the mover account>
  MOVER_PASSWORD=<the password for the mover account>
-Optionally set up those accounts with google, but our tests do that anyways
- Run tests

### 5.4. Justifications for Unfixed Issues

- **Code Pattern: [No pattern, just says 'All issues'](#)**

    1. **‘Detect missing process.exit’**


        - **Location in Git:** [`backend/src/index.ts#L44`](https://github.com/Dormdash-CPEN321/DormDash/blob/ee50449596bc9711fcc12f09662c9cebb66b9a0d/backend/src/index.ts#L44)
        - **Justification:** false positive, we call process.exitCode=1

    2. **‘Detect missing process.exit’**

        - **Location in Git:** [`backend/src/config/database.ts#L9`](https://github.com/Dormdash-CPEN321/DormDash/blob/ee50449596bc9711fcc12f09662c9cebb66b9a0d/backend/src/config/database.ts#L9)
        - **Justification:** false positive, the solution says to add an error listener, however the error is on an error handler.
